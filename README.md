This is the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) of the magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain via 
the Preprocessed OASIS dataset, which is found in the /home/groups/comp3710/ directory on the Rangpur cluster

The visualisation of the trained model is done via a 2D image of the manifold. 
Code was based on MNIST autoencoder code from lectures
